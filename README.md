# Yūgen's Terrain Authoring Toolkit
The public version of the Marching Squares Terrain plugin for godot.

This project is an effort to create a simple to use and powerfull terrain authoring tool inside godot aimed at 3d pixel art games. However, the plugin featured in this project can be used for a wide variety of games and experimentation is encouraged! As of right now the plugin has the following features:

* Elevate and lower terrain based on cells in a chunk grid
* Level terrain to a user-set height
* Smooth terrain depending on the average height of neighbouring cells
* Create a bridge between two points by drawing a line between them
* Use up to 256 Textures/color palettes in the Vertex Painter
* Paint a mask map that determines whether selected cells should draw `MultiMeshInstance3d` grass instances
* Get debug information for selected cells
* Change the internal marching squares algorithm vertex merge threshold value resulting in smoother or blockier terrain
* Change global terrain settings like the default wall texture, texture blend mode, grass animation fps and more...

For more in-depth documentation, please refer to the _documentation_ folder in the addon.

## Runtime LOD streaming (experimental)
There is an experimental runtime chunk streaming + LOD system in:
`addons/MarchingSquaresTerrain/runtime_lod/`

Quick demo:
1. Open `addons/MarchingSquaresTerrain/runtime_lod/demo/lod_demo.tscn`
2. Run the scene
3. Use arrow keys to move, PageUp/PageDown to go up/down

Using it with an existing terrain:
- Add a `LodChunkManager` node to your scene
- Assign your `MarchingSquaresTerrain` node to the manager’s `terrain` field (or set `terrain_path`)
- (Recommended) Pick a `simple_preset` (ex: `MST_ONLY_3X3`, `PROXY_ONLY_AUTHORED`, `PROXY_ONLY_INFINITE_NOISE`, `HYBRID_BALANCED`)
- Or manually set `view_radius_chunks`, `lod_distances`, `max_mesh_applies_per_frame` for performance
- Seam handling uses *skirts* (set `skirt_depth` > 0 to hide cracks between different LODs)

## Known Issues

1. Smooth texture blending breaks at certain elevated/lowered cell edge cases
2. d3d12 doesn't load terrain material properly when in game on some devices

## PR Workflow

Please target and base your PR's on `public-testing` instead of `main` otherwise we cannot review or aprove them!

Also make sure to give a good description of what your PR fixes or adds so we don't have to go through all the files unnecessarily.

###
A big thanks to the above people for giving helpful insights, discussing certain features and thinking together about math related problems. Without them I couldn't have finished the plugin as fast as I have.
